**This Repo. is designed to auotmate a startup Annaul Profit Sharing Plan on Ethereum Blockchain using Smart Contracts.**

## Tools needed to run this repo.:
- Navigate to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) or check this tutorial of how to run your own copy of [Remix](https://www.sitepoint.com/remix-smart-contracts-ethereum-blockchain/#:~:text=Remix%20is%20a%20Solidity%20IDE,compile%20and%20debug%20Solidity%20code.&text=IDE%20stands%20for%20Integrated%20Development,compiling%2C%20executing%20and%20debugging%20code.)
  
  - Is an Integrated Development Environment that's used to write, complie, and debug Solidity code.
- Install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) development chain,from Truffle Suite.
  
  - is a blockchain that runs on the local machine without the need to run the full nodes, you can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment
-  point MetaMask to `localhost:8545` or `localhost:7545` whatever rpc server  you setup your network on.
   
   -  is a web browser extension that allows you to run Ethereum dApps right in your browser without running a full Ethereum node.









# Resources

Building the next financial revolution isn't easy, but we need your help, don't be intimidated by the semicolons!

There are lots of great resources to learn Solidity. Remember, you are helping push the very edge of this space forward,
so don't feel discouraged if you get stuck! In fact, you should be proud that you are taking on such a challenge!

* For some succinct and straightforward code snips, check out [Solidity By Example](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example)
  
* For a more extensive list of awesome Solidity resources, checkout [Awesome Solidity](https://github.com/bkrem/awesome-solidity)
* Another tutorial is available at [EthereumDev.io](https://ethereumdev.io/)

* If you enjoy building games, here's an excellent tutorial called [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)

* If you would like to know more about version 0.5.0, you check out the documentation [Solidity v0.5.0](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/050-breaking-changes.html)

* To know more about the browser-based compiler & IDE (Remix), please read this awesome explanatory project [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project)



* In Kovan network, I used 2 websites to fund my account, you can use [Kovan network](https://faucet.kovan.network/) but it's timely & quantity limited, you can only used once every 24 hours.

* Another great source is [kovan-testnet/faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet#) once you are verified, which is easy can be done by signing in with your GitHub account. In the comment section you paste your wallet address & you can ask up till 4 Ether; larger quantities take longer approval process.


* I transfer wei instead of Ether, because of the limited quantity on hand but you can check all transactions on [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/) and since in this testnet I used the same wallet accross the board, here is the all transactions including contract creation
